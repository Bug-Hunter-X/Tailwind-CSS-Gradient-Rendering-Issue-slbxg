```html
<div class="p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgb(59, 130, 246), rgb(156, 61, 255));">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This solution uses inline CSS to define the gradient. If a browser does not support the Tailwind classes, it falls back to this approach.  Ensure your Tailwind configuration is properly set up and that you have the necessary peer dependencies installed.
