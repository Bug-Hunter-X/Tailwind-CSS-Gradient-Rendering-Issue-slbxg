```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes.  The issue arises when the browser doesn't fully support the `gradient-to-r` (right-to-left gradient) direction or encounters problems parsing these classes due to conflicts with other CSS rules or a misconfigured Tailwind setup.
